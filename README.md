# Matrix-multiplication-using-verilog


## Overview

This project implements a **2×2 matrix multiplication** module using Verilog. It takes two 2×2 matrices as input and produces the resulting 2×2 matrix after multiplication.

## What is Matrix Multiplication?

Matrix multiplication is a binary operation that takes a pair of matrices and produces another matrix. For two matrices **A** and **B** to be multiplied, the number of columns in **A** must be equal to the number of rows in **B**.

For 2×2 matrices:

Let

A 

```math
A=\begin{bmatrix}X \ A \\\ B \ Y\end{bmatrix}
```
